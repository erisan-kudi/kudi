                1. Nature of a Meme Coin<br>
KIKIcat ($KIKI) is classified as a meme coin, created primarily for entertainment, community engagement, and/or trending purposes. It is not a traditional financial asset or investment product, nor is it intended to serve as a store of value or a safe asset.
<br><br>
2. High-Risk Asset<br>
The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and meme coins are especially speculative. Prices may experience rapid increases or decreases in value within short timeframes. There is a risk of losing your entire investment. Please invest responsibly and only what you can afford to lose.
<br><br>
3. Legal and Regulatory Limitations<br>
KIKIcat ($KIKI) may not be recognized as a financial product or security in certain jurisdictions. Laws, regulations, and taxation related to cryptocurrency can vary significantly by country and are subject to change. Such changes could introduce additional risks to holders and investors.
<br><br>

The information provided in this document (and any other channels, official or unofficial) does not constitute investment, financial, legal, tax, or other professional advice.

Neither the KIKIcat ($KIKI) development team, marketing team, nor community moderators shall be held liable for any investment losses, technical failures, security breaches, or any other damages (monetary or otherwise) arising from involvement with KIKIcat ($KIKI).
<br><br>
7. Personal Data and Security<br>
Cryptocurrency transactions require users to maintain strict control over their wallets, private keys, and personal information. Any loss or theft resulting from inadequate security practices is the sole responsibility of the individual user. KIKIcat ($KIKI) or its related entities cannot be held accountable for such incidents.
<br><br>
8. Beware of Scams and Phishing<br>
Fraudsters and scammers may impersonate official KIKIcat ($KIKI) channels. Always verify information through official sources, remain vigilant with suspicious links or messages, and never share private keys or sensitive information.

Forecasting future prices or value in the cryptocurrency and meme coin market is highly speculative and inherently uncertain. No economic or technical analysis can guarantee specific outcomes or returns.
<br><br>
